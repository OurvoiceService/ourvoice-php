Usage
-----

Here is a quick breakdown on how it works. First, you need to set up a **MessageBird\Client**. Be sure to replace **YOUR_ACCESS_KEY** with something real.

```php

$ourvoice = new \Ourvoice\Client('YOUR_API_KEY');

```

That's easy enough. Now we can query the server for information. Lets use getting your campaigns overview as an example:

```php
// Get your balance
$myCampaigns = $ourvoice->campaigns->getList();
```
